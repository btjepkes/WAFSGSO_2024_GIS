## Introduction

### What is GIS?

### Why Learn GIS?

## Spatial Data Types

How the surface of the Earth is represented digitally.

- Spatial coordinates = X, Y, sometimes Z
- Types of spatial data models (types)
  - Vector
  - Raster
  - Networks
- Many file formats / extensions for each
  - Examples: .tiff, .shp, .gdb

### Vector

Represents space as points, lines, and polygons.

- **Points** -- single vertex
- **Lines** -- two or more vertices
- **Polygon** -- three or more vertices with the last vertex equal to the first

#### Common Vector Data Types:

-

### Raster

Represents space as a grid of pixels or cells.

### Data Type Considerations

> Raster is faster, but vector seems more correcter.

Spatial data files do their best to represent the world. Accuracy needs will depend on each use case. Mapping an entire state vs. a single forest stand. Each sensor and GPS receiver will vary.

## Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

- Often the most confusing part of introductory GIS
- Layers need to have same CRS for spatial operations


### Geographic CRS


### Projected CRS

Representing a 3D sphere on a 2D surface

- No perfect projection exists (prioritize for needs)
- Different regions and states have their own projections
- Many software have on-the-fly projection

### CRS Nomenclature

- English Name
- WKT ~ Well Known Text
- WKID ~ Well Known Identifier (ESRI)
- EPSG
- PROJ.4

## Software & Programs

Many different types and levels of GIS software available. See more examples [here](https://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/software.html).

## Spatial Operations

**First Law of Geography (Tobler's Law):**
"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."

Clip, union, intersect, re-project, dissolve.
