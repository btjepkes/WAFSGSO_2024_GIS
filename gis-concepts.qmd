## Introduction

### What is GIS?

GIS = **G**eographic **I**nformation **S**ystem

- The tool that we use to capture, store, process, analyze, and visualize spatial information.
- Helps us understand and assess patterns in spatial locations and attributes about those locations.

### What are spatial data?

> **First Law of Geography (Tobler's Law):**
> "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."

### Why Learn GIS?

## Spatial Data Types

How the surface of the Earth is represented digitally.

- Spatial coordinates = X, Y, sometimes Z
- Types of spatial data models (types)
  - Vector
  - Raster
  - Networks
- Many file formats / extensions for each
  - Examples: .tiff, .shp, .gdb

### Vector

Represents space as points, lines, and polygons.

- **Points** -- single vertex
- **Lines** -- two or more vertices
- **Polygon** -- three or more vertices with the last vertex equal to the first

#### Common Vector Data Types:

More than **80 different vector file types** available across software and systems!

- NetCDF

### Raster

Represents space as a grid of pixels or cells.

### Data Type Considerations

> *Raster is faster, but vector seems more correcter.* - Old GIS Adage

Spatial data files do their best to represent the world. Accuracy needs will depend on each use case. Mapping an entire state vs. a single forest stand. Each sensor and GPS receiver will vary.

### A Note on Shapefiles

Stop Using Shapefiles: [http://switchfromshapefile.org/](http://switchfromshapefile.org/)

While shapefiles are common and widely supported, there are several downsides:

- Multi-file format causes sharing issues
- Attribute (column) names limited to 10 characters
- No more than 255 total attributes
- Total size limit of 2 GB

#### Alternatives for Consideration

- **OGC GeoPackage** <i style= "color: green;" class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>
  - Leading replacement for .shp
- **GeoJSON**
  - Very good for web mapping and transfer
- **OGC GML**
- **OGC KML**
- **Esri GeoDatabase**
  - Suitable if operating within only ESRI products

## Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

- Often the most confusing part of introductory GIS
- Layers need to have same CRS for spatial operations


### Geographic CRS


### Projected CRS

Representing a 3D sphere on a 2D surface

- No perfect projection exists (prioritize for needs)
- Different regions and states have their own projections
- Many software have on-the-fly projection

### CRS Nomenclature

- English Name
- WKT ~ Well Known Text
- WKID ~ Well Known Identifier (ESRI)
- EPSG
- PROJ.4

## Software & Programs

Many different types and levels of GIS software available. See more examples [here](https://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/software.html).

### Proprietary

- ArcGIS Pro
- Cadcorp
- MAPublisher
- Carto

### Open-Source

- QGIS
- GRASS GIS
- SAGA GIS
- GeoDa
- R / Python / Julia

### Other Web GIS Tools

- ArcGIS Online
- Google Earth Engine
- Leaflet
- Mapbox
- Mango Map
- Felt

## Field Collection

### GPS Recievers


### Mobile Applications

Many apps available for field data collection.

#### Esri Field Maps (for Esri)

- Integrates with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Pro
- Both Android and iOS support

#### QField or Mergin Maps (for QGIS)

- Integrates with QGIS Cloud environment

#### Avenza Maps (for anything)

- Works with multiple programs

Can be used with external GPS receivers (Bad Elf, Garmin GLO), else uses the internal GPS chip.

## Spatial Operations

### Extraction

- Clip
- Select
- Split
- Split By Attributes

### Overlay

Tools to overlay multiple feature classes to combine, erase, modify, or update spatial features, resulting in a new feature class. New information is created when overlaying one set of features with another. (Esri)

- Erase
- Identity
- Intersect
- Spatial Join
- Union
- Update

### Proximity


### Other
re-project, dissolve.


## Types of Maps

- [https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/)

### Reference Maps

Used for navigation or to identify points of interest.

### Presentation Maps

Used in news articles and in journals.

### Statistical Maps


#### Choropleth

Data need to be normalized! Animals per unit area (density) or Attribute per individual (rate)

#### Dot Density

#### Proportional Symbol

#### Cartogram

#### Flow Map

#### Density Map
