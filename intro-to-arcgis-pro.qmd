## Introduction

ArcGIS Pro is a comprehensive GIS application that enables users to create, manage, analyze, and share spatial data in both 2D and 3D environments. It serves as a central hub for all your GIS work, providing tools for data visualization, geoprocessing, cartography, and more.

Whether you're a GIS professional, a researcher, or a student, ArcGIS Pro offers a versatile platform to explore, analyze, and communicate spatial information.

### AGOL

One of the many benefits of ArcGIS Pro is that is provides integrations with other Esri products, such as ArcGIS Online.

## Licensing

There are 3 types or categories of ArcGIS Pro licenses available. In addition to the base installation of Pro, there are also Extensions that can provided extended functionality.


### ArcGIS Pro Single Use License:

- A Single Use License is assigned to a single machine and is tied to a specific ArcGIS Pro installation.
- It's ideal for individual users or small teams who require exclusive access to ArcGIS Pro on a dedicated workstation.
- This license type is perpetual, meaning it does not expire, but it is only valid for the version of ArcGIS Pro it is assigned to.

### ArcGIS Pro Named User License:

- A Named User License is assigned to individual users and requires authentication through ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise.
- Named User Licenses are typically associated with an organization's subscription to ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise.
- Users can access ArcGIS Pro from any machine connected to the internet, providing flexibility and mobility.
- This license type allows for easy collaboration, sharing, and access to additional ArcGIS Online services and content.

### ArcGIS Pro Concurrent Use License:

- A Concurrent Use License allows multiple users to share a pool of licenses hosted on a license manager.
- Users can access ArcGIS Pro from any machine connected to the network where the license manager is installed.
- The number of concurrent licenses available is determined by the license administrator and can be adjusted based on usage requirements.
- This license type is suitable for organizations with a large number of users who may not require full-time access to ArcGIS Pro.

### ArcGIS Pro Extensions:

- ArcGIS Pro offers various extensions that provide additional functionality beyond the core software.
- Examples of extensions include Spatial Analyst, 3D Analyst, Geostatistical Analyst, and Image Analyst.
- Extensions can be purchased separately and added to existing ArcGIS Pro licenses as needed, allowing users to customize their workflows based on specific requirements.
