# GIS Concepts {background-image="img-rivers.webp" background-opacity="0.1"}

::: footer
:::

Understanding spatial data, software, and tools.

## What is GIS?

::: footer
:::

-   Started simply as a way to store and query **spatial data**
-   Capable ecosystem of tools & techniques

## Why Learn GIS?

::: footer
:::

-   Everywhere is somewhere
-   Adds another dimension to data
-   JOBS!

## Spatial Data Types

How the surface of the Earth is represented digitally

-   Spatial coordinates = X, Y, sometimes Z

-   Types of spatial data models (types)

    -   Vector

    -   Raster

    -   Networks

-   Many file formats / extensions for each

    -   Examples: .tiff, .shp, .gdb

## Vector Data

Represents space as points, lines, and polygons

## Vector File Formats

:::

## Raster Data

Represents space as a grid of pixels

## Data Type Considerations

::: footer
:::

*Raster is faster, but vector seems more correcter*

-   Spatial data files do their best to represent the world
-   Accuracy needs will depend on each use case
    -   Mapping an entire state vs. a single forest stand
    -   Each sensor and GPS receiver will vary

## Projections (aka CRS)

Representing a 3D sphere on a 2D surface

-   Often the most confusing part of introductory GIS
-   No perfect projection exists (prioritize for needs)
-   Different regions and states have their own projections
-   Many software have **on-the-fly projection**
-   Layers need to have same CRS for spatial operations

## CRS Nomenclature

Different ways to reference a CRS.

-   English Name
-   WKT \~ Well Known Text
-   EPSG
-   PROJ.4

## Software & Programs

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Open-Source\*

-   QGIS
-   GRASS GIS
-   GeoDa
-   R / Python / Julia
:::

\*Many open-source software have paid tiers for extending functionality or rely on paid services for sharing
:::

## Web Geospatial Tools

-   ArcGIS Online
-   Google Earth Engine
-   Leaflet
-   Mapbox
-   Mango Map
-   Felt

## Common File Types

How spatial data and attributes are stored and transferred

-   

## Apps for Field Collection

-   Esri: Esri Field Maps -- ArcGIS Online -- ArcGIS Pro

-   QGIS: QField or Mergin Maps -- QGIS

-   Avenza Maps -- Works with multiple programs

Basics of scripting in ArcGIS Pro using Jupyter.

## Why use scripting for GIS?

-   Allows for reproducible science and workflows
    -   Supplementary material for manuscripts
-   Turns repetitive tasks into simple tools
-   Some tools are only available in the coding interface
-   Integrates with other tools and methods
    -   Modules, extensions, APIs
    -   Data wrangling and visualization
